# WASH-HANDS-REMINDER
## This is small fun project that i did with my brother. All it does is remind you to wash your hands every time you approach it.
</br>
This device can be put near a basin and it will tell you wash your hands for a period of 20 seconds.
</br>
</br>
As you approach it a timer starts for 20 secs, the duration which it expects you to wash your hands properly.
</br>
</br>
This project was made using ARDUINO.
</br>
